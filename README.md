# What is this

My website. Currently undergoing migration to a npm/Webpack/Pug project.

# Getting started

- `npm run build` will build the production-ready static site on `/dist` directory
- `npm run develop` will directly serve it on port 80 on a volatile dev server
- `npm run watch` will build the site automatically whenever a change is made (but will not embed a webserver)

# To-Do

- Localize to spanish
- Support static & scripted language switch
- Introduce task to build & deploy the site parallel on english and spanish locales
