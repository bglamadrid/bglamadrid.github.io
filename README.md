# What is this

My website. Currently undergoing migration to a [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/what-is-jamstack)
by using a combination of Node.JS,
[Webpack](https://webpack.js.org),
[Pug](https://pugjs.org)
and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
through my [pugtail](https://github.com/bglamadrid/pugtail) base.

# TODO

- Localize to spanish
- Support static & scripted language switch
- Introduce task to build & deploy the site parallel on english and spanish locales
