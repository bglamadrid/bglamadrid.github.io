h2 😁 About me
p I'm a web and software developer! I like three things in life:
ul
  li singing,
  li playing videogames and
  li going cycling
p There's also that I write code in, and advocate for, open-source. Sharing is where it's at.
p At a young age I've gotten used to learning by doing and building things, and I've always had an obsession for computers and videogames.
