          .more(class='grid gap-4 max-w-xl')
            p Since I was young I took a liking to learn by doing and creating things.
            p When I was 10 I was given an Intel Pentium IV computer where I had a blast playing several games on Windows XP.
              |
              | I was specially delighted with the sandbox and slapstick of the early 3D GTA franchise.
              | At some point I even wanted to create a webpage about the series, to showcase my knowledge of the many bits and bolts that every game had to offer.&nbsp;
              | And I did learn how to write HTML, there was a site called #[a(class='underline text-blue-600' href='https://comocreartuweb.com') comocreartuweb.com] that had a nice spanish course on the matter.
              | Forward time some years, and due to my interest in games I ended up learning to script mods for #[a(class='underline text-blue-600' href='https://mtasa.com') multi theft auto] üò¨&nbsp;
              | using their #[a(class='underline text-blue-600' href='https://lua.org') lua] engine.
            p Although I didn't make anything that stood the test of time, it did make me all the more interested in how computer logic operates.
              |
              | So I took a short career and graduated in a technical school while I do several kinds of jobs for most of its running time.
